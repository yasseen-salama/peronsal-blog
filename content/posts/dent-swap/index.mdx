At TDSoftware GmbH, I had a cool opportunity to dive into the DeFi space by dveeloping a Vue.js app named DENT Swap (https://swap.dent.exchange) that uses the Uniswap protocol to swap tokens in a decenztralized manner; aka no exchange.
The app developemnt is part modern web development thanks to TypeScript, Vue.js and part tinkering with Smart Contracts on the Etherum blockchain thanks to the Uniswap protocol. Proud of how it turned out, and it's a neat reflection of what I enjoy working on.
Here's a small demo of swapping DENTs for Ethereum using the app:

    allowFullScreen
